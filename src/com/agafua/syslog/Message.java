 * Message for sending by worker implementation.

 * No message capacity restrictions.
 * rfc5424(The Syslog Protocol) recommends supporting at least 2048 bytes
 * for messages and the capacity depends of the transport protocol.
 * rfc5426(Transmission of Syslog Messages over UDP) mentions size of 65535
 * minus the udp headers. Over the network udp messages will be truncated
 * by MTU. Localhost MTU in linux systems is 65536.
